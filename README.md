# atmega-development-board

I have created this atmega development board for a line following robot for a client.
This line following robot is a trolley which follows line and stop at its station.
The repository contains only the design atmega development board just to give some idea how this board is designed.
Everyone has full right to clone this design and manufacture development board directly from this design.
The development board can be used for other porpose such as for learning porpose.

Feel free to give any suggestion and ask question.
Thank you.
